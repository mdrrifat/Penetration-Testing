# Basic SQL Injection                                                                                                      
SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed.

Havij is a popular and controversial automated SQL injection tool that was used primarily for penetration testing and ethical hacking purposes. SQL injection is a type of cybersecurity vulnerability that can allow attackers to manipulate a web application's database by injecting malicious SQL code. Havij was designed to automate the process of finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
